 A small Discord moderation bot, without a command handler.


# Getting started

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
* Git
* A code editor (Visual Studio Code, Atom, notepad++, etc.)

## Insturctions

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers and make an application. After creating your application, you should have the option to create a bot user.

2. Make a folder for which your bot's coding will be in

3. Do shift + right click and select open powershell (or cmd depending on your PC)

4. Run the script below

```sh
npm init && npm install discord.js
```

> *Note*: This will make a file called `package-lock.json` and a directory called `node_modules`, please don't delete that.

5. Get your bots token.

> **Reminder**: Keep your bot token safe, anybody can have complete access to your bot if they have it.

6. Place your bot's token **between** the quotation marks, you can also edit the prefix if you'd like.

8. Run your bot by typing `node bot` into your Terminal / Powershell

9. You can use [this](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#) to generate an invite link for your bot

Yay! Your bot is running!

Enjoy the bot, updates are frequent so always return to replace your `bot.js` with the newest one.
